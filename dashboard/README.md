# Dashboard

Compliance metrics and summaries.

The `compliance` directory contains generated metrics (`metrics.json`) and correction summaries (`correction_summary.json`).
Metrics are sourced from `analytics.db`, including the new `code_audit_log` and
`correction_history` tables which track placeholder audits and code fixes.
