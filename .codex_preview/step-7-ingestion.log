Step 7 (DRY RUN): Snapshot ingestion planning
- Analyzed priority snapshot files and wrote per-file plans under .codex_preview/migration_plans/
- Updated docs/codex_migration_plan.md remains the high-level plan; details split per item.
- Added docs/automation_onboarding.md (applies in next APPLY batch).
- No snapshot files were modified or deleted.
