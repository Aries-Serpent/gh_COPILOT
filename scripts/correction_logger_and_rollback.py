1. Log every change to analytics.db with timestamp, rationale, compliance score, rollback reference.
2. Implement auto-rollback for failed syncs or corrections.
3. Summarize corrections in compliance reports (Markdown/JSON) for dashboard.
4. Visual indicators: tqdm, start time, timeout, ETC, status updates.
5. Anti-recursion validation before rollback.
6. DUAL COPILOT: Secondary validator checks correction integrity and compliance.
7. Fetch web search for correction/rollback scripts and integrate cognitive learning.
