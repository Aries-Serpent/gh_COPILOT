# Quantum algorithm integration

The placeholder module `scripts/quantum_placeholders/quantum_placeholder_algorithm.py` currently simulates quantum processing.

## Task
- Implement full quantum algorithm integration as outlined in `docs/COMPLETE_TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_WHITEPAPER.md`.
- Replace the placeholder simulation with the actual algorithm.

## Notes
- Ensure compliance with enterprise standards and dual copilot validation.
- Update documentation and tests accordingly.
