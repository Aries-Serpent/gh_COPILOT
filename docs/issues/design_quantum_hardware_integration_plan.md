# Issue: Design quantum hardware integration plan

## Summary
Move beyond simulation‑only routines and stubbed helpers to enable execution on real quantum hardware when available.

## Tasks
- Draft a document (`docs/quantum_hardware_integration_plan.md`) describing required APIs, execution flow, and hardware fallbacks.
- Outline refactors needed to replace simulation stubs.
- Gather feedback and iterate on the plan before implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Comprehensive integration plan drafted and reviewed.
- Plan covers API design, execution flow, and fallback strategies.
- No code changes until the design is approved.

## Testing
- Document review
