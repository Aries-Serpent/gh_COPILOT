# Phase 5 Task Stubs – Started

The following tasks have begun and are tracked for status reconciliation:

- UnifiedDisasterRecoverySystem
- FlaskDashboard
- ComplianceMetrics
- DatabaseSynchronizationEngine

## Reconciliation workflow

Run `python scripts/docs_status_reconciler.py` before committing documentation changes. The script updates `docs/task_stubs.md` and `docs/status_index.json`, which are checked in CI for drift.
