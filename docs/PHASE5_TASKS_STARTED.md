# Phase 5 Task Stubs – Started

These task stubs originate from the gap analysis report and have been formally started. Each task includes an excerpt from the consolidated "Task Stub – gh_COPILOT Gap Task Stubs" statement for traceability.

## 1. Create UnifiedDisasterRecoverySystem
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Design Specs: Draft requirements for UnifiedDisasterRecoverySystem (autonomous backups, restore workflow, compliance logging)."
- [x] **Progress:** 100% – scheduler writes to external backup root, restore uses checksum verification, and success/failure paths are fully tested.

## 2. Build Flask-based Dashboard
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Framework Setup: Scaffold Flask app and templates powered by analytics.db."
- **Status:** Started – base Flask blueprint and metrics routes outlined.

## 3. Implement Database Synchronization Engine
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Schema Review: Map schemas for production, analytics and auxiliary DBs" and "Sync Logic: Build real‑time synchronization with conflict resolution and logging."
- **Status:** Started – synchronization interface and logging hooks scoped.

## 4. Expand Monitoring and Optimization
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Analytics Expansion: Integrate ML-enhanced monitoring and placeholder quantum hooks."
- **Status:** Started – monitoring extensions and ML pipeline placeholders drafted.

## 5. Enhance Session Management Modules
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Integrity Checks: Implement zero‑byte detection, wrap‑up validation and anti‑recursion safeguards."
- **Status:** Started – session integrity rules and guard utilities initialized.

## 6. Extend Script Generation and Cleanup
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Pattern Library: Extend template intelligence using classification and clustering (e.g., KMeans)."
- **Status:** Started – template classification strategy and cleanup workflow sketched.

## 7. Align Documentation with Implementation
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Audit Pass: Review whitepaper, README and guides; reconcile overstated claims (quantum features, test success)."
 - **Status:** In Progress – placeholder quantum features documented; [README.md](../README.md) and [Complete Technical Specifications whitepaper](COMPLETE_TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_WHITEPAPER.md) now explicitly state that quantum modules run exclusively in simulation mode.
 - [ ] **Progress:** 90% – backup guide now documents module-level helpers alongside the updated README and whitepaper statements.

## 8. Establish Robust Testing & Compliance Checks
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Comprehensive Tests: Run full pytest suite; resolve failures; add coverage for new modules."
- **Status:** Started – test coverage matrix and compliance hooks prepared.

## 9. Define Timeline & Risk Mitigation Plan
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Planning (Week 1): Finalize designs for DR, GUI and sync engine" and subsequent phase milestones.
- **Status:** Started – milestone document and risk table scaffolding underway.

## 10. Integrate Correction Logging with Dashboard
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Compliance Review: Ensure CorrectionLoggerRollback paths and compliance scores meet targets."
- **Status:** Started – dashboard hooks for correction logs specified.

## 11. Finalize Placeholder Audit and Compliance Scripts
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Placeholder Audit: Execute scripts/code_placeholder_audit.py and integrate results into dashboard."
- **Status:** Started – audit pipeline and analytics insertion strategy outlined.

## 12. Update Changelog and User Prompts
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Changelog & Guides: Ensure changelog entries and user guides reflect current implementation."
- **Status:** Completed – changelog and user prompts updated with backup guidance. (100%)

## 13. Prepare for Enterprise Pilot
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Pilot (Week 5): Deploy to staging and collect feedback."
- **Status:** Started – staging deployment checklist and feedback loop defined.

## 14. Establish Governance Standards
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Risk Controls: Prioritize scope, incrementally integrate databases, enforce test coverage, conduct regular reviews and bundle doc updates with code changes."
- **Status:** Started – governance standard draft and compliance criteria initiated.

## 15. Set Up Continuous Monitoring
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Analytics Expansion" and "Session Management Tie‑in: Link metrics to session lifecycle for full visibility."
- **Status:** Started – continuous monitoring schedule and metric linkages outlined.

## 16. Implement Backup Validation Checks
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Integrity Checks: Implement zero‑byte detection, wrap‑up validation and anti‑recursion safeguards" applied to backup paths.
- **Status:** Implemented – disaster recovery now enforces external backup roots and aborts when misconfigured.
- [x] **Progress:** 100% – disaster recovery enforces external backup roots and restore test verifies success.

## 17. Implement Anti-Recursion Guards
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Integrity Checks: Implement zero‑byte detection, wrap‑up validation and anti‑recursion safeguards."
- **Status:** Completed – validator tests enforce external backup roots. (100%)
- **Status:** Started – anti-recursion decorator and PID tracking drafted.
- **Progress:** [ ] 50% – anti-recursion guard decorator tests expanded and imports validated.

## 18. Standardize Dual-Copilot Validation
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Session Management Tie‑in: Link metrics to session lifecycle for full visibility" and "Comprehensive Tests" for validation.
- **Status:** Completed – orchestrators now use `run_dual_copilot_validation` with comprehensive tests.
- **Progress:** [x] 100% – dual-copilot validation standardized and covered by failing-order tests.

## 19. Clarify Quantum Placeholder Features
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Audit Pass: Review whitepaper, README and guides; reconcile overstated claims (quantum features, test success)."
  - **Status:** In Progress – 90% complete. README and Complete Technical Specifications whitepaper explicitly note that quantum modules run in simulation mode; packaging exclusions remain documented.

## 20. Implement Compliance Metrics Calculations
- **Statement Excerpt:** "Metrics Integration: Display compliance trends, rollback logs and placeholder metrics" coupled with "Quantitative Goals: All modules implemented; tests >95% coverage; compliance score ≥0.9; dashboard latency <1 min."
- **Status:** Started – compliance score formulas and dashboard metric wiring initiated.
