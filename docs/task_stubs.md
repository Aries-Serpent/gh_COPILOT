# Task Status Overview

| Task | Status | Progress |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create UnifiedDisasterRecoverySystem |  | 100% |
| Build Flask-based Dashboard | Completed – real-time streaming, correction logs and rollback views are available. | 100% |
| Implement Database Synchronization Engine | Completed – synchronization engine streams changes with conflict resolution and event logging. | 100% |
| Expand Monitoring and Optimization | Started – monitoring extensions and ML pipeline placeholders drafted. |  |
| Enhance Session Management Modules | In Progress – zero-byte detection context manager implemented; wrap-up validation and anti-recursion safeguards active. |  |
| Extend Script Generation and Cleanup | In Progress – KMeans clustering operational for template classification with cleanup workflow scaffolded. |  |
| Align Documentation with Implementation | Completed – placeholder quantum features documented; [README.md](../README.md) and [Complete Technical Specifications whitepaper](COMPLETE_TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_WHITEPAPER.md) now explicitly state that quantum modules run exclusively in simulation mode. | 100% |
| Establish Robust Testing & Compliance Checks | Completed – integration suite and compliance hooks finalized. | 100% |
| Define Timeline & Risk Mitigation Plan | Started – milestone document and risk table scaffolding underway. |  |
| Integrate Correction Logging with Dashboard | Completed – dashboard displays correction logs alongside streaming metrics. | 100% |
| Finalize Placeholder Audit and Compliance Scripts | Started – audit pipeline and analytics insertion strategy outlined. |  |
| Update Changelog and User Prompts | Completed – changelog and user prompts updated with backup guidance. (100%) |  |
| Prepare for Enterprise Pilot | Started – staging deployment checklist and feedback loop defined. |  |
| Establish Governance Standards | Completed – governance standards updated with compliance threshold enforcement. | 100% |
| Set Up Continuous Monitoring | Started – continuous monitoring schedule and metric linkages outlined. |  |
| Implement Backup Validation Checks | Implemented – disaster recovery now enforces external backup roots and aborts when misconfigured. | 100% |
| Implement Anti-Recursion Guards | Completed – depth-based aborts and PID tracking now enforced. (100%) | 100% |
| Standardize Dual-Copilot Validation | Completed – orchestrators now use `run_dual_copilot_validation` with comprehensive tests. |  |
| Clarify Quantum Placeholder Features | Completed – README and Complete Technical Specifications whitepaper state that `scripts/quantum_placeholders` are simulation-only stubs reserved for future quantum interfaces and excluded from production builds. Import guards and tests now ensure they cannot load in production. The roadmap tracks eventual hardware integration. |  |
