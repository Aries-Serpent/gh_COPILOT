# Qualitative Feedback from Dashboard Walkthrough

## Overview
Stakeholders reviewed the dashboard and compliance features, focusing on usability, insight clarity, and disaster-recovery workflows.

## Feedback Highlights
- **Usability:** Navigation was intuitive but stakeholders requested a quick-access menu for compliance reports.
- **Insight Clarity:** The compliance score breakdown was clear; however, users want contextual tooltips explaining each metric.
- **Recovery Workflows:** Automatic backup triggers were appreciated, yet manual rollback steps need clearer documentation.

## Required Follow-ups
- Add a sidebar shortcut to the compliance reports in the dashboard UI.
- Introduce tooltips that define lint, test, and placeholder metrics on score hover.
- Expand recovery documentation with a step-by-step rollback example.

## Next Steps
Feedback will inform updates to backlog tasks and documentation. Follow-up items are tracked in `docs/PHASE5_TASKS_STARTED.md`.
