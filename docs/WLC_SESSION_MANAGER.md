# WLC Session Manager

The Wrapping, Logging, and Compliance (WLC) methodology provides a structured approach for session execution.

- **Wrapping**: validates the environment before actions occur.
- **Logging**: records progress and results in `production.db`.
- **Compliance**: tracks enterprise compliance scores and audit details.

This file documents how `scripts/wlc_session_manager.py` implements the WLC methodology with dual-copilot validation and tqdm progress indicators.
