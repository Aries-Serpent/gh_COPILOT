# Continuous Improvement Phases

## Short-Term
- Deploy ML-based pattern recognition with feedback loop `[status: active]`
- Introduce pipeline-wide compliance gating checks `[status: active]`

## Mid-Term
- Expand autonomous systems to new modules and subsystems `[status: active]`
- Integrate quantum-ready phases for algorithm research `[status: planned]`
- Pilot integrations with IBM, IonQ, and D-Wave hardware `[status: planned]`

## Long-Term
- Full ML-driven pattern library `[status: planned]`
- Automated compliance gating across pipelines `[status: planned]`
