# Phase 5 Timeline Plan

This document outlines the Phase 5 rollout with week-by-week milestones and identifies key risks with corresponding mitigation strategies. Integration points are reviewed weekly to ensure cross-module alignment.

## Week-by-Week Milestones

### Week 1
- Establish Phase 5 scope and confirm integration points across modules.
- Draft initial implementation tickets and assign owners.

### Week 2
- Implement foundational interfaces for new features.
- Validate data flows between existing modules and newly introduced components.

### Week 3
- Integrate completed features into staging environment.
- Conduct cross-team walkthrough of integration points and adjust timelines as needed.

### Week 4
- Finalize feature set and harden interfaces based on integration feedback.
- Prepare rollout plan for production deployment.

### Week 5
- Execute production rollout with staged deployment.
- Collect metrics and verify success criteria across integrated modules.

## Risk Table

| Risk | Impact | Area | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Misaligned integration schedules | Medium | Cross-module coordination | Hold weekly syncs to realign timelines and dependencies. |
| Incomplete interface contracts | High | API definitions | Require design reviews before implementation and enforce contract tests. |
| Performance regression during rollout | Medium | Deployment pipeline | Run load tests in staging and enable feature flags for gradual exposure. |
| Lack of stakeholder visibility | Low | Project tracking | Publish weekly progress updates and maintain transparent dashboards. |

## Integration Review

Integration points are reviewed every week. Progress is documented and timelines are updated accordingly to keep all teams aligned.
