This project values concise, direct language. Follow these guidelines when writing documentation, code comments, and commit messages:

- Use active voice and present tense whenever possible.
- Avoid ambiguous phrases such as "maybe" or "should"; provide explicit instructions.
- Prefix log messages with the emitting module name using `log_message()` from `utils.log_utils`.
- Keep sentences short and focused on a single idea.
- Wrap lines at 120 characters to improve readability.
