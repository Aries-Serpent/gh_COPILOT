# Quantum Integration Plan

This roadmap outlines upcoming steps for extending quantum capabilities.

## Roadmap

1. **Stabilize Simulator Infrastructure** – ensure deterministic fallbacks for
   all algorithms.
2. **Hardware Connectivity** – integrate IBM Quantum and alternative providers
   with secure token management.
3. **Hybrid Workflows** – expose combined classical/quantum pipelines to
   analytics dashboards.
4. **Production Readiness** – graduate validated modules from
   `scripts/quantum_placeholders` into supported production paths.
