Codex Integration Leftovers
===========================

Items deferred or requiring follow-up:

- Optional sequencer module (from codex_task_sequence.py): consider adding
  `gh_copilot/automation/sequencer.py` with stdlib-only helpers for dependency
  ordering; avoid heavy deps (numpy/torch).

This file records snapshot components that cannot be ingested cleanly without
larger refactors or are intentionally deferred.
