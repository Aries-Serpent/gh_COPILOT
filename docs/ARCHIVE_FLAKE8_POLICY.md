# Archive Scripts and Flake8

The `archive/consolidated_scripts/` directory contains historical scripts preserved for reference.
These files are no longer maintained and generate numerous flake8 errors.
To keep linting focused on active code, the directory is excluded in `.flake8` rather than refactoring all archived scripts.
