# Continuous Improvement Roadmap

This roadmap tracks upcoming milestones for the project and is used by the CI
validation script to ensure each item has a status marker or issue link.

## Milestones
- ML pattern recognition interface integration `[status: planned]`
- Autonomous system expansion across modules `[status: planned]`
- Stricter compliance checks and automated audits `[status: planned]`
- Quantum algorithm upgrade pipeline `[status: planned]`

## Validation
Run `python scripts/validate_roadmap.py docs/continuous_improvement_roadmap.md`
to verify that each milestone contains either a status marker such as
`[status: in-progress]` or a link to a tracking issue.
