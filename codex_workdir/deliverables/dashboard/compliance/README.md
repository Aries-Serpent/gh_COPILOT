# Compliance Dashboard

This directory stores compliance metrics and summaries generated by the audit tooling.

## Running Audits

Execute the placeholder audit script from the project root:

```bash
python scripts/code_placeholder_audit.py --workspace-path .
```

Findings are written to `databases/analytics.db` in the `placeholder_tasks`
table and a snapshot of open/resolved counts is appended to
`placeholder_audit_snapshots`.

## Viewing Results

After an audit run, the dashboard directory is populated with JSON files:

- `placeholder_counts.json` – current open and resolved placeholder totals
- `placeholder_history.json` – chronological history of placeholder snapshots
- `placeholder_summary.json` – overall audit summary and compliance metrics

Metrics include `auto_removal_count` tracking automated placeholder removals
with rollback logging.
