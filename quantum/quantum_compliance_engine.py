"""
MANDATORY: Quantum-inspired compliance scoring and clustering.
1. Finalize quantum-inspired compliance scoring and clustering in all generation engines.
2. Implement multi-pattern matching, quantum field redundancy, modular weighting.
3. Integrate via qiskit where specified.
4. Visual indicators: tqdm, start time, timeout, ETC, status updates.
5. Anti-recursion validation before quantum processing.
6. DUAL COPILOT: Secondary validator checks quantum logic integrity and compliance.
7. Fetch web search for quantum compliance scripts and integrate cognitive learning.
