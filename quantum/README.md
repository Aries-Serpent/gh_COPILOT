# Quantum Utilities

This package contains quantum-inspired tools used by the gh_COPILOT suite.

- **optimizers/quantum_optimizer.py** – Provides simulated annealing and other placeholder algorithms.
- **algorithms/database_search.py** – Demonstrates Grover-style searches against SQLite tables.

These utilities log progress via `utils.log_utils._log_event` when integrated in larger workflows.
