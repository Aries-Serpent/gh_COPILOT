# Continuous Improvement Roadmap

This document outlines upcoming iterations including timelines, responsible
teams and review checkpoints.

## Upcoming Iterations
- ML pattern recognition rollout — **Team ML** `[status: planned]`
- Autonomous system expansion — **Systems Team** `[status: planned]`
- Compliance enhancements and audits — **Compliance Team** `[status: planned]`
- Quantum algorithm milestones — **Quantum Team** `[status: planned]`

Each item should include either a link to a tracking issue or a status marker.
The CI job `validate_roadmap.py` ensures compliance with this rule.
