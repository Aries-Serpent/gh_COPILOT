## Environment Adaptation Rules

### Automatic Adaptations

1. **Logging Levels**
   - Development: DEBUG level
   - Staging: INFO level
   - Production: WARNING level

2. **Security Settings**
   - Development: Relaxed validation
   - Staging: Standard validation
   - Production: Strict validation

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Development: Debugging features enabled
   - Staging: Balanced optimization
   - Production: Maximum optimization

### Custom Adaptations

Create custom adaptation rules in the database:

```sql
INSERT INTO environment_adaptation_rules 
(rule_name, source_pattern, target_pattern, environment_filter, transformation_logic)
VALUES 
('debug_to_prod', 'DEBUG=True', 'DEBUG=False', 'production', 'Disable debug mode for production');
```
