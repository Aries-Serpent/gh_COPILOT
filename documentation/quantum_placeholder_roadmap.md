# Quantum Placeholder Roadmap

The placeholder quantum modules have been relocated to `scripts/quantum_placeholders/`.
These stubs illustrate planned quantum features and remain importable for testing
purposes. Current placeholders include:

- `quantum_annealing.py`
- `quantum_superposition_search.py`
- `quantum_entanglement_correction.py`

Future iterations will replace these modules with fully implemented algorithms
within the production `quantum` package.
