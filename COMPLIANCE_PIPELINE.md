## Compliance Pipeline

The compliance pipeline ensures every contribution meets organizational and
regulatory expectations. It flows through three primary phases:

### Ingestion
- Collect source artifacts and metadata.
- Securely store submissions for downstream evaluation.

### Validation
- Execute automated checks, linters, and tests.
- Perform dual‑copilot review to confirm policy adherence.

### Reporting
- Summarize validation outcomes and compliance metrics.
- Archive logs and deliver reports to stakeholders.
