# Compliance Pipeline

This document outlines the repository's compliance pipeline and the key
responsibilities at each step.

1. **Policy Definition** – Establish regulatory requirements and internal
   standards. Update documentation and configuration to reflect these rules.
2. **Static Analysis** – Run formatters, linters and dependency checks to ensure
   code quality and proper binary tracking.
3. **Dynamic Testing** – Execute unit and integration tests along with security
   scans. Validate runtime behaviour and safeguard coverage.
4. **Audit Review** – Collect outputs from automated checks and perform manual
   inspection. Apply the dual‑copilot pattern for independent verification and
   record findings.
5. **Reporting & Certification** – Compile results into compliance reports,
   update logs and publish summaries for stakeholders. Archive artifacts for
   traceability.
6. **Continuous Monitoring** – Track compliance metrics over time and feed
   results back into the pipeline. Schedule periodic reassessments to maintain
   alignment with evolving standards.
