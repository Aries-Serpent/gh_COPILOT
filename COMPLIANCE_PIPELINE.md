## Compliance Pipeline

The compliance pipeline ensures every contribution meets organizational and
regulatory expectations. It progresses through three structured phases that
keep submissions accountable and traceable.

### Ingestion
- Collect source artifacts, metadata, and submission context.
- Verify authenticity and log the initial intake.
- Securely store submissions for downstream evaluation.

### Validation
- Execute automated checks, linters, and tests.
- Perform dual‑copilot review to confirm policy adherence.
- Record compliance metrics and audit trails.

### Reporting
- Summarize validation outcomes and compliance metrics.
- Archive logs and deliver reports to stakeholders.
- Flag follow‑up actions for unresolved issues.
