  # [Issue]: Enterprise compliance metrics integration & gaps closure (Phase 5/6)
  > Generated: 2025-08-08 | Author: System

  ## Objective
  Implement the composite compliance scoring system and close key implementation gaps (monitoring, session wrap-up validation, placeholder audit integration, failing tests, lint & type issues) to reach production-ready status for gh_COPILOT.
